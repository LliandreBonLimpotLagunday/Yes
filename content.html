	  <h1>EFFECTS</h1>
	  <P>Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera,
	  diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water
	  and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks.</P>
	  
	  <H1>SOLUTIONS</H1>
	  <H2>1.Educate to change consumption and lifestyles</H2>
	  <P>In the end, changing the face of this crisis involves education to motivate new behaviors. Coping with the coming era of water scarcity will require major overhaul of all forms of consumption, from individual use to the supply chains of major corporations, like GE. Some regions led by India, Australia and the Southwest U.S., are already facing the freshwater crisis.
	  The most critical task is making sure the problem is much better understood worldwide.</P>

	  <H2>2.Recycle wastewater</H2>
	  <P>In March, World Water Day panelists urged a new mindset for wastewater treatment. Some countries, like Singapore, are trying to recycle to cut water imports and become more self-sufficient. The rich East Asian republic is a leader in developing advanced technology that cleanses wastewater for other uses,including drinking.</P>

  <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
  <P>703 million people lack access to clean water. That's 1 in 10 people on the planet. Women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours carrying water every day, walking 6 kilometers (about 3.7 miles) every day to haul 40 pounds of water.</P>
